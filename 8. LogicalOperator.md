```
$and
$or
$nor
$not
```

### $and
This operator will search all the records and reurn only those which satisfy both the conditions.
```
db.collection_name.find({$and: [ condition1, condition2 ]})
```
#### Example
```
db.Students.find({$and: [ 
    {age: {$ne: 20}}, 
    {class: {$eq: "BCA"}}
]})
```

### $or
This operator will search all the records and reurn those which satisfy atleast one of the condition.
```
db.collection_name.find({$or: [ condition1, condition2 ]})
```
#### Example
```
db.Students.find({$or: [ 
    {age: {$ne: 20}}, 
    {class: {$eq: "BCA"}}
]})
```

### $nor
This operator is basically reverse of $or operator. It will return all the documents with is not satifying any of the conditions.
```
db.collection_name.find({$nor: [ condition1, condition2 ]})
```
#### Example

db.Students.find({$nor: [ 
    {age: {$eq: 17}}, 
    {class: {$eq: "BCA"}}
]})
```

### $nor
This operator take only one condition. It returns all the documents not satisfing the condition. 
```
db.collection_name.find({ field: { $not: { condition }}})
```

db.Students.find({ age: { $not: { $gt: 20 } } })
```


# Element Query
These operator are used to find documents based on the fields.
```
$exists
$type
```

### $exists
This operator will return the documents where this field exists. We can pass only boolean values in it.
```
db.collection_name.find({ field: { $exists: boolean }})
```
#### Example
```
db.Students.find({ age: { $exists: true } })
```

### $type
This operator will return the documents with the field types matches. We can give multiple datatypes by making a array.
```
db.collection_name.find({ field: { $type: "dataType" }})
```
#### Example
```
db.Students.find({ age: { $type: "int" } })
```
#### or
```
db.Students.find({ age: { $type: {"int", "double"} } })
